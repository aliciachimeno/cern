      <p>CERN experiments like ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb produce staggering volumes of high-dimensional data — from calorimeter grids to particle tracks. Finding meaning in this data requires more than storage and speed: it requires reduction.

        This course introduces powerful dimensionality reduction techniques tailored for experimental physics. Whether you're trying to compress high-resolution detector outputs, filter noise in real time, or visualize latent structure in collision data, you'll leave with tools to simplify complexity without losing physics.</p>

      <h3>What You'll Learn</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How to distinguish signal from noise using PCA, LDA, and SVD</li>
        <li>The role of nonlinear methods (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP) in HEP visualization</li>
        <li>When to use feature extraction vs. feature selection in detector data</li>
        <li>Strategies for integrating reduction techniques into ML workflows at CERN        </li>
      </ul>

      
      <h3>Who Should Attend?</h3>
      <p>CERN scientists and engineers analyzing multi-dimensional detector data</p>
